  <h1>Maria D Hernandez</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my online portfolio!</p>
  <p> I have decided to change career paths. Previously, I worked in the art and design field. 
      There were aspects that I found to be engaging, but I eventually lost interest. It felt like I wasn't being challenged. 
      When I learned about front-end software development, I saw a way to combine my past experience into something new. 
      I am very excited to learn more and take my skills to new heights. A few of my early goals include:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Building my first interactive website</li>
      <li>Creating custom graphics for my web pages</li>
      <li>And implementing UI design</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I'll be updating this page along my journey. Until then, here is a little friend to make you smile.</p>
